<h3>
	Sumzine is a biannual slow-fashion zine based out of NYC. We carry the torch of Dame Westwood, "Buy less, choose well, make it last!" 
</br>
Not your typical sustainability-loving, fashion editorial magazine. We wanted to put aside that "go green hippiness" and bring in the cool, New York City downtown chic vibes. 
</br>
The design of Sumzine is vibrant and bold, with a mixture of earthy feels. Since Sumzine's theme changes with every issue, we wanted to keep the branding and design simple, clean, constant and versatile.
